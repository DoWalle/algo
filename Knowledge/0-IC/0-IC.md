An **integrated circuit** or **monolithic integrated circuit** (also referred to as an **IC**, a **chip**, or a **microchip**) is a set of [electronic circuits](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit) on one small flat piece (or "chip") of [semiconductor](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Semiconductor) material, usually [silicon](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Silicon). [Large numbers](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Transistor_count) of tiny [MOSFETs](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/MOSFET) (metal–oxide–semiconductor [field-effect transistors](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistors)) integrate into a small chip. This results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, and less expensive than those constructed of discrete [electronic components](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Electronic_component). The IC's [mass production](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Mass_production) capability, reliability, and building-block approach to [integrated circuit design](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit_design) has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete [transistors](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Transistor). ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of [electronics](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Electronics). [Computers](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Computer), [mobile phones](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Mobile_phone) and other [home appliances](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Home_appliance) are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs such as modern [computer processors](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Computer_processor) and [microcontrollers](https://en.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Microcontroller).
